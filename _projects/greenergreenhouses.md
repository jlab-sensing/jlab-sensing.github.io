## Abstract
The Greener Greenhouses project is an ongoing preliminary work which began in Summer 2023. The project is aimed at exploring the intersection of visible light communication with plant physiology to reduce energy consumption, cost, and human intervention in greenhouses and other protected agriculture scenarios. To accomplish this, we propose an ultra-low power open-source sensing node that is powered by and communicated to via the existing supplemental lighting commonly found in protected agriculture. This approach will yield reduced costs in both power consumption as well as labor compared to traditional monitoring solutions.
